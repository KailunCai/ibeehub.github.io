# About us


iBeehub was created by a group of enthusiastic entrepreneurs with the goal of helping people launch their ideas. iBeehub not only provides the funding capital, but it also focuses on building healthy relationships with resourceful professionals who have the right skills to take ideas from concept to reality.

The idea to create iBeehub was born by a group of alumni from the reputable Peking University. Their passion for entrepreneurship brought them to New York, at Deloitte on April 17th to introduce their business model. At Deloitte, located at the Rockefeller Center, the group of alumni presented to some top senior investors about the unique idea and the innovative business model in their hands. The investors were not only impressed about the idea, but they were also ready to offer financial support to bring iBeehub to life.
