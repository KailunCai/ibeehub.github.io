# Our Mission

iBeeHub consistently commits to incubating and supporting newly established enterprises.  We will be industrious and frugal to incubate a number of dynamic and innovative businesses and entrepreneurs; in the meantime, we will grow with them and share the joy of entrepreneurship with them! 
"Sharing ideas, cooperative intellectual and human resources, establishing a base in New York first and then connecting US and China" is the spirit of our corporation.
